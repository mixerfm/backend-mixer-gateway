        The HTTP X-Idempotency-Key request header field can be used to carry
        idempotency key in order to make non-idempotent HTTP methods such as
        POST or PATCH fault-tolerant.

        The HTTP X-Accept-Version request header field allows API consumers to call 
        the intended version of the API. If header is not present, it implies that the
        oldest supported version of the entity should be retrieved.
        Supported version is defined by number of clients which consume old endpoint.
        In resolving entity version, in consideration are taken non-breaking versions, e.g.:
        current | requested | provided
        1.5     | v1        | 1.5
        1.5     | null      | 1.5
        2.1     | v1        | 1.8 (max non breaking supported version)
        2.1     | null      | 1.8 (max non breaking supported version)
        2.1     | v2        | 2.1
      required: false
