            Type of the reaction. Some reactions are contrary, and if one is set, the other is unset, e.g.:
            - LIKE will override DISLIKE, and opposite
            - RECOMMEND will override DO_NOT_RECOMMEND, and opposite
            - BLOCK will override UNBLOCK, and opposite
            There are also reactions that can be used multiple times, but won't result as boolean flags in responses, e.g.:
            - REPORT
          enum:
            - LIKE
            - DISLIKE
            - BLOCK
            - UNBLOCK
            - RECOMMEND
            - DO_NOT_RECOMMEND
            - REPORT
